# Tuenti-Challenge-2019
Answers of the Tuenti Challenge 2019 using Node.JS. In every challenge I have added the text of the challenge so if the links are down, you can still check the challenge. Anyway, you can check it here: [https://contest.tuenti.net/Challenges](https://contest.tuenti.net/Challenges)

## How to execute it?
In a terminal use:
> node index.js -c challenge_number -f path_to_the_test_input_file

For example, for the challenge 1 using the input file located in the project folder Challenge1 called sample.txt, you would type:
> node index.js -c 1 -f ./Challenge1/sample.txt
